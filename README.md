Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms using Kaggle dataset.


## Task-01: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

This repository contains the implementation of a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on features like **square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms**.  

---

## 📌 Objective  
- Build a regression model to predict house prices.  
- Apply data preprocessing and feature engineering.  
- Evaluate the model performance using standard metrics.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used for this task is from Kaggle:  
[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## 🚀 Steps Involved  
1. Import and explore the dataset  
2. Preprocess data (handle missing values, feature selection, encoding)  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train a Linear Regression model  
5. Evaluate performance using metrics (MAE, MSE, R² Score)  
6. Visualize results  

---

## 📊 Results  
- The model successfully predicts house prices based on selected features.  
- Evaluation metrics show the effectiveness of Linear Regression for this dataset.
